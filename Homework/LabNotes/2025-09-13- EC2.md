- Infrastructure hiearchy - Regions - AZs
	- Regions are 100% isolation from other regions
		- May contain multiple AZs 
	- AZ does not have 100% isolation
		- If one fails, it can affect the others
- EC2 manages the computers (compute resources- processors, memory, storage such as SSD and HDD, gpus)
	- It is IAAS (infratructure as a service)
		- Have to manage security, scale, operating systems to name a few
	- they exist in specific AZs not regions
- VPCs are networks but for the cloud
	- private to us - control everything
	- EC2s must be inside a VPC
	- **Are regional resources - span an entire region**
